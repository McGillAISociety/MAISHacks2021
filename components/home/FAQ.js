        MAIS Hacks and McGill Artificial Intelligence Society does not tolerate
        harassment, bullying, or discrimination in any form. In the case of an
        incident, participants can report it confidentially to any staff member,
        who will deal with the situation appropriately and/or report the
        incident to an organizer. Staff will be present at the registration
        booth in the mezzanine and monitoring the McGill AI Society account on
        Discord for all active hackathon hours.

        In the case of an allegation, accused parties will be removed from the
        Discord and venue, and will no longer be allowed to participate in MAIS
        Hacks. The rest of the team who are not involved in the allegation will
        be allowed to continue the Hackathon. If relevant, prizes will be
        withheld from the accused party until a judgment is made by Engineering
        Undergraduate Society and/or McGill University. Further action will be
        taken at the discretion of McGill Artificial Intelligence Society,
        Engineering Undergraduate Society, and/or McGill University.
